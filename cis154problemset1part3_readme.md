Problem Set 1.2
C - Professor Penta
1/25/2024, Due: 2/1/2024

Everything is self-explanatory. All assigned problem sets are finished. For exercise 1.3, I ended up removing all of the errors at the end.

I had a lot of trouble with using linux bash commands. It seems if I manually add files or change the names of a directory or files, then there are issues with running programs. I had to redo a portion of the problem sets because I had to delete everything and start from scartch, and what I copied did not paste properly.

I still aim to download a C/C++ compiler locally.
