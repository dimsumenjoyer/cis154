Problem Set 5.1 is self-explanatory.

In Problem Set 5.2, since both flag1 and flag2 are true - it prints "ping ping."

Problem Set 5.3 is self-explanatory.

In Problem Set 5.4, a recursive function is made to used as an exponent.

In Problem Set 5.5, I created a function that's eventually the the fabs() function but with more accuracy since it uses a long double. I had to use the sqrt() function from math.h because my exponent function doesn't work with fractions and I didn't know how to know how to a function to account for that.

Problem Set 5.6 is self-explanatory.
