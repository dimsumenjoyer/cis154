Problem Sets 7.1-7.3 are self-explantory and are a waste of my time and energy to comment on.

In 7.4, using else and my conditional statement breaks my code and I don't understand why.
Also after Professor Penta mentioned the ? operator in C on Thursday, I'd like to learn how to use it but my randomName function doesn't work.
It might also be because my compiler stopped working on my PC for some reason.
Please show me how to use this.

On 7.5, I had issues printing the sum of the array because I kept on printing the sum without using the array.

In 7.6, I couldn't figure out the sorting algorithm and I don't know how to fix it. I'm just turning it in as it is so I can focus on my calculus 2 and discrete mathematics classes.
