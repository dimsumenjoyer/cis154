Arrays are a lot more confusing to me than I thought, so I struggled with this last couple of chapters more than usual.

8.1 is self-explanatory.

In 8.2, I don't understand why the histogram array has to be initalized in main. It seems to be cleaner to initialize the array inside of other functions.

In 8.3, Professor Penta helped me. However, on line 40, letterHist(str, histogram); is used. 
I don't understand why the histogram array is changed if the function letterHist doesn't return an array and is a void function.

In 8.4, code like str[i] = ((str[i] - 'a' + 13) % 26) + 'a'; was difficult for me to write. I don't understand the - 'a' part just for + 'a' to be used later on.
Conceptually though, this is just a caeser's ciphier which was to to understand.
I usaully have an easy time understanding concepts and sometimes I like to conceptualize them mathematically.
However, implementing things into code is a lot more difficult for me.

I have no idea what to do on 8.5, so I did what I can but I can't finish that section.
